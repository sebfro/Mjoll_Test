# Code test

This test is all about code quality and refactoring.

## Introduction

Sometimes when we write code or join existing project(s), the code quality over time decreases as technical debt increases. Suddenly your code looks like spaghetti, and is hard to understand.
When other developers, or even you yourself look at the code again 6 months later, it is easy to get frustrated on how difficult it is to both understand and expand on the functionality.
Code maintenance is very important, and refactoring is one of the corner stones of keeping tech debt down.

## Getting started

You will need a:

* Text editor, e.g. Visual Studio Code
* npm installed

1. Navigate to `assignment_one` directory
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory of assignment_one
3. Run `npm test` and verify that all tests are green.

## Your task

Your task is to improve the code, such that you are satisfied with the maintainability and code quality.

Two files can be found in the project, `src/bar.ts` containing the code that needs to improve, and `test/bar.spec.ts` containing a set of tests verifying the "application" is doing what it should.
You are free to change or add new tests as well, but ensure you have good test coverage over the logic in `src/bar.ts`.
Your main focus should be improving the code so it becomes more readable, easier to understand, and easier to expand. Keep an extra eye out for type safety, and ensure in your refactoring that the code becomes solid on type safety.

There are many ways to approach this task, so there's not just one solution. You will need to use your experience and creativity to decide what you believe will be an improvement over what is there.

We expect you'll need anywhere from 1 to 3 hours to complete this task.

Good luck!
